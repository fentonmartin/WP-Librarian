If you want to contribute to WP-Librarian feel free. I'm usually quite busy so it might be a while before I get round to trying to merge it, but I appreciate help from those that wish to give it.

The documentation is currently quite sparce, but it's being worked on. If you have questions that reading the source don't answer then email me at kittsville[at]gmail.com and I'll try and answer it. But bear in mind that silly questions get silly answers!
