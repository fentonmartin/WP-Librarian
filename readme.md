# WP-Librarian

WP-Librarian is an inventory management system for WordPress. Loan, return and schedule items, efficiently tracking your extensive Library with ease.

WP-Librarian is currently in its third Alpha release. A Beta release is [planned](https://github.com/kittsville/WP-Librarian/wiki/V1-Bowie) some time in the future.

The documentation is currently quite sparse, but it's being worked on. If you have questions that reading the source doesn't answer then email me at kittsville[at]gmail.com and I'll try and answer it. But bear in mind that silly questions get silly answers!

####Requirements

- PHP version 5.4 or higher
- WordPress version 3.9 or higher

####Installation

WP-Librarian is in Alpha release so don't go installing this on a production website unless you know what you're doing.

1. Download the latest version of WP-Librarian
2. Go to WordPress Admin Dashboard
3. Go to Plugins->Add New->Upload Plugin
4. Upload WP-Librarian.zip
5. Activate plugin

####Contributing

If you want to contribute to WP-Librarian feel free, just remember to fork the dev branch, as it has the latest version of WP-Librarian, rather than the master. I'm usually quite busy so it might be a while before I get round to trying to merge it, but I appreciate help from those that wish to give it.
