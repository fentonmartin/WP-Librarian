WP-Librarian
============

WP-Librarian allows an organisation to manage and loan an extensive inventory of diverse items such as books, DVDs and comics. WP-Librarian holds information about the item such as its authors, condition, donor and ISBN number. Items can be loaned to registered members and are kept track of to ensure items are returned when they are due. Members who return items late can be charged a fine, although note that WP-Librarian has no built in payment system. Items can also be set to be loaned in the future, allowing for item’s to be reserved.
Future functionality is planned that will allow for multiple libraries to be networked, so that books can be moved between libraries with ease, along with other useful additions.

WP-Librarian is currently under development with a planned release in early Setember 2014. Until such time as WP-Librarian is released, no build should be considered safe or stable enough for a production site.
